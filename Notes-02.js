console.time('your code took');/* this is to check the time taken to run code */
console.log('hello console');
console.log(4 + 43); /* this is an intiger */
console.log(34); /* this is an intiger */
console.log(true); /* this is an boolean */
console.log([34, 3, 5, 6]); /* this is an array */
console.log({ saqlain: 'Javascript', marks: 40 }); /* this is an javscript Object */
console.table({ saqlain: 'Javascript', marks: 40 }); /* this is an js Object in tabular form*/
